# NOTE: Windows Singleplayer is Maintained by Volunteers.
This subproject is maintained exclusively by volunteers, and will not receive official support from the core 2009scape team. If you do have issues, however, feel free to make an issue in this repository and hopefully a volunteer will be able to help you out :). 


# Getting Started: Windows

* 1: Download or clone this repository.
* 2: After you unpack the .zip (if you just downloaded it) or it finishes cloning (if you cloned it), open up the folder that it created.
* 3: In this folder there will be a **run-windows.cmd**, execute this to start everything up.
* 4: You can simply run the game with option 1.
* 5: When you're done, make sure to use the "exit" option in the menu to properly shut everything down.
