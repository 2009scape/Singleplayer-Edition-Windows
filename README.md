# NOTE: Windows Singleplayer has been postponed indefinitely.

Windows has too many issues both as an operating system and a development platform. If you're a Windows user, we highly recommend you either switch to a real operating system, or check out our live game here: https://2009scape.org/

If you're a developer and you want to take over the Windows Singleplayer Edition, feel free to send PRs and we'll take down this notice. As it stands right now though, no one wants to maintain it and it's too unstable to keep releasing.


# Getting Started: Windows

* 1: Download or clone this repository.
* 2: After you unpack the .zip (if you just downloaded it) or it finishes cloning (if you cloned it), open up the folder that it created.
* 3: In this folder there will be a **run-windows.cmd**, execute this to start everything up.
* 5: You can simply run the game with option 1.
* 6: When you're done, make sure to use the "exit" option in the menu to properly shut everything down.

# Getting Started: Linux
